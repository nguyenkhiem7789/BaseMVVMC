When you have to choose an architectural pattern, you have the challenge to understand which one suits better your needs. 
Among these patterns, MVVM is one of the best choices since itâ€™s very powerful and easy to use at the same time.

Unfortunately this pattern is not perfect, the main lack of MVVM is the routing management.
We have to add a new layer to get the power of MVVM and routing in the same patterns. It becomes: Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator (MVVM-C)
